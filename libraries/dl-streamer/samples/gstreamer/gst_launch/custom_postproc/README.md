# Detection and classification samples (gst-launch command line)

Those samples demonstrate how to construct a detect and classify pipelines using the command line utility `gst-launch-1.0`.


* [Detection](./detect/README.md): sample demonstrates how to create a custom post-processing library for DLStreamer that converts YOLOv11 tensor outputs to detection metadata.
* [Classification](./classify/README.md): sample demonstrates how to create a custom post-processing library for DLStreamer that converts classification model outputs to classification metadata using the GStreamer Analytics framework.
